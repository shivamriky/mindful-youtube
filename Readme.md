# Mindful Youtube
**Mindful youtube** is a chrome plugin inspired by the idea that bad habits can be broken if we introduce hurdles in 
our brain's automatic response, also called the 'habit loop'.
We often binge watch youtube for hours and realize we have wasted hours
watching useless videos. 'Mindful Youtube' would help in breaking this habit.

**Mindful Youtube** will create a small popup on each youtube video which will ask a simple question that whether
the youtube video is productive or just a distraction. 


# Installation
Clone the github repo and load the plugin from chrome:://extensions page using the 'Load Unpacked' button.
Please note I am still developing the extension so there are many logs in the scripts.

### Features

 1. Create a popup asking the user whether the video is a distraction or productive.
 2. Auto-pause the video on start.

### Help
 
 I am still new to chrome extension so you are welcome to provide me ideas and help in the development.
 

### v0.0
